# To-Do List

A simple website that allows you to track and manage your personal tasks.

***

### Features


* **Comfortable sorting**: Your tasks are shown from not done to done, from newest to oldest,
so you definitely won't lose something important.


* **Deadlines**: Having troubles with self-discipline and being on-time? No worries,
there'll be a clear deadline shown on the page.


* **Tags**: It's always better to have an additional sorting of what you have to do.
WIth tags on the website you can easily start from the family-related tasks and end with something personal.


* **Go back and update**: Forgot something? Made a mistake? Don't worry! You can change details of your task.

## Installing

If you are interested, here are the steps to launching my little website on your device. However, mind that you need
to have Python3 already installed.

```shell
git https://github.com/raychw/to-do-list
cd to_do_list
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
